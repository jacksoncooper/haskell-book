-- Can be rewritten using Applicative methods:

-- Cannot be rewritten using Applicative methods:

doSomething4 :: Monad m => (t -> m a) -> (a -> m b) -> (b -> m c) -> t -> m (a, b, c)
doSomething4 f g h n = do
  a <- f n
  b <- g a
  c <- h b
  pure (a, b, c)

doSomething5 :: Monad m => (t -> m a) -> (a -> m b) -> (b -> m c) -> t -> m (a, b, c)
doSomething5 f g h n =

  -- f n >>=
  -- \a ->
  -- g a >>=
  -- \b ->
  -- h b >>=
  -- \c ->

-- ^ So, this compiles. I have no idea why. Is not '\a -> ...' part of the
--   expression 'f n >>= ...'?

-- "If you don’t believe us, try translating 'doSomething4' to Applicative: so
--  no resorting to >>= or join."

-- I did, had to use 'join' and add the Monad constraint:

doSomething6 :: Monad f => (t -> f a) -> (a -> f b) -> (b -> f c) -> t -> f (a, b, c)
doSomething6 f g h n = join $ (\a -> join $ (\b -> (\c -> (a, b, c)) <$> h b) <$> g a) <$> f n

-- This implementation will not compile:

-- doSomething6 f g h n = (\a -> (\b -> ((\c -> (a, b, c)) <$> h b) <$> g a)) <$> f n

f :: Integer -> Maybe Integer
f 0 = Nothing
f n = Just n

g :: Integer -> Maybe Integer
g i =
  if even i
  then Just $ i + 1
  else Nothing

h :: Integer -> Maybe String
h i = Just $ "10191" ++ show i

-- doSomething4 f g h 2 = Just (2, 3, "101913")
