-- Exercise 2
-- Took a hint from @bschwb. First solution worked but pattern matching against a triple using a case expression was really redundant.
-- GHC -Wall warns that pattern matches are non-exhaustive because "Patterns not matched: (LogMessage _ _ _) (Node _ (Unknown _) _)". This should be a nonissue because a MessageTree should never contain an unknown LogMessage.
