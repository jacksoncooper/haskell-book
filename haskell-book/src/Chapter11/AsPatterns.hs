-- isSubseqOf :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [a] -> Bool
-- isSubseqOf xs ys = foldr ((&&) . (`elem` ys)) True xs

-- "Remember that the sub-sequence has to be in the original order!"
-- isSubseqOf "blah" "halbwoot" -> False.
-- isSubseqOf "blah" "wboloath" -> True.

isSubsequenceOf :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [a] -> Bool
isSubsequenceOf [] _ = True
isSubsequenceOf (x:xs) ys = (elem x ys) && isSubsequenceOf xs (tail . dropWhile (/= x) $ ys)

-- ^ 'tail . dropWhile (/= x)' would normally be dangerous if not guaranteed to
--   never be evaluated if 'elem x ys' fails.

--   This doesn't use an as-pattern!
